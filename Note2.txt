I have over 15 years of experience as a Data Engineer, Software Engineer, and DevOps professional, with a strong foundation in backend application development and data architecture. For the past five years, I’ve specialized in DevOps, leveraging tools like AWS CDK, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines to automate and optimize infrastructure and application delivery.

I have extensive experience building and managing data pipelines, often using tools like Spark and Airflow, and integrating them with AWS services such as RDS, S3, and Lambda. My technical expertise includes programming in Python, Java, and Node.js, and I’m skilled at designing RESTful APIs and working with SQL databases.

In my current role as a Senior DevOps Engineer, I was responsible for driving technical decisions backed by research, mentoring team members through code reviews and architecture discussions, and working cross-functionally with stakeholders to address business needs. I also focused on performance monitoring, logging, and alerting to ensure production support readiness.

I thrive in agile environments and am familiar with GitHub workflows for CI/CD, enabling iterative delivery of reliable software. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with modern application development practices, including serverless architectures and containerization.

What excites me about this opportunity is the focus on financial data systems and pipelines, as I have experience working with structured finance datasets and understand the unique challenges and opportunities in this domain. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning emerging technologies, and contributing to a collaborative, high-performing team environment."




I’ve gained significant experience in my current role, but I’m seeking new challenges that will allow me to grow professionally, expand my skill set, and take on more responsibilities.

I built a scalable data pipeline to process structured financial data using AWS services like S3, RDS, and Lambda. I collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements, chose the appropriate tech stack, and ensured the architecture was optimized for performance and scalability. The project was delivered on time and is now handling millions of records daily.
